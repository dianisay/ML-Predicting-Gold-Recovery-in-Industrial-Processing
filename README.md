# ML-Predicting-Gold-Recovery-in-Industrial-Processing
In modern mining operations, efficient recovery of valuable metals like gold, silver, and lead is essential to maximizing profitability and reducing waste.   This project simulates a real-world production pipeline where we model and evaluate gold recovery at different stages of mineral processing using machine learning.
